 Here are the rules of the game explained in simple terms:

Each player rolls a dice to get a number from 1 to 6.
If a player rolls a 1, it's the next player's turn, and their score doesn't change.
If they roll any other number from 2 to 6, that number is added to their current score.
A player can choose to "Hold" at any time to keep their points. Then it's the next player's turn.
The goal of the game is to reach 100 points. Once one player reaches this goal, the game ends, and that player wins.
It's as simple as that! Just roll the dice, collect points, and try to win!
